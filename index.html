            <h3>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h3>
        <p>I'm Madison Morris. I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design.</p>

            <h3>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3>
        <p>While I really enjoy graphic design for print, I took a design class for the screen last year that I really enjoyed. It was so different from what I was used to and I'm interested in learning more about designing for the web.</p>

            <h3>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h3>
        <p>I don't have any experience with HTML/CSS?JS.</p>

            <h3>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
            <p>I'm hoping to expand upon my design skills for the screen. Also, I'm interested in how designers interact with coders/developers in a team setting, or how they might design while handling the coding aspect. </p>

            <h3>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
            <p>I expect it to be a lot of trial and error for things that are relatively simple on programs like Adobe. For instance, instead of dragging and dropping an image to the exact place you want it to be on the page, you might have to mess with the code several times in order to get the dimensions right.</p>

            <h3>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p>I think the 
                <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/">It's Nice That</a>
                website is a good example of effective design because of its grid systmes, visual hierarchy, and use of hover states.

            <h3>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p>I think the 
                <a href="https://www.ikea.com">Ikea</a>
                website is a good example of effective communication because of its friendly, clean design. They use simple, intuitive calls to action that make the website easy to navigate.

            <h3>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p>I think the 
                <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com">Barnes and Noble</a>
                website works well because it's a very familiar format that most users would be comfortable navigating. It provides many curated lists that allow users to keep scrolling until they find what they're interest in. There's also options to search the site through categories or the search bar.
