    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This towering loaf is packed with applesauce and chopped apples, plus lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Enjoy a slice with a cup of tea in the afternoon or turn it into dessert with a scoop of ice cream or whipped cream. Use tart, firm baking apples (such as Mutsu, Cortland, Braeburn, Northern Spy and Stayman Winesap) in this cake for best results. The bread is best enjoyed the day it is baked, but will stay soft and delicious for a few days when stored in an airtight container or bag at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&frac34; cup/180 milliliters vegetable or canola oil, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>1cup/200 grams sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup/250 grams unsweetened applesauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>&frac34; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1&frac12; teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2&frac14; cups/290 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large apple, peeled, cored, and cut into &frac14; to &frac12;-inch pieces (about 1&frac12; cups)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
            <p class="steps">Step 1</p>
            <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Oil (or spray) a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and line it with a piece of parchment paper that hangs over the two long sides.</p>
        
            <p class="steps">Step 2</p>
            <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, eggs, applesauce, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.</p>
        
            <p class="steps">Step 3</p>
            <p>Whisk in the baking powder and baking soda, then, using a flexible spatula, stir in the flour. When only a few streaks of flour remain, fold in the apples.</p>
        
            <p class="steps">Step 4</p>
            <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles. Bake until puffed, golden and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. If the top of the bread is becoming too dark before it's fully baked, lightly tent it with foil.</p>
        
            <p class="steps">Step 5</p>
            <p>Let the cake cool in the pan set on a rack for 15 minutes, then carefully remove it from the pan using the parchment paper sling. Set the loaf on the rack to cool completely before slicing. The bread is best enjoyed the day it is baked, but will stay soft and delicious for a few days when stored in an airtight container or bag at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Recipe Website Examples</h2>
        <p class="website"><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/banana-bread-monkey-bread-recipe-11805820">Allrecipes</a></p>
        <p>I like how there is a "quick facts" box at the top of the recipe with information about timing and servings. Also, the recipe gets right to the point with the necessary ingredients and steps listed neatly below. I enjoy the cleanness of the design and options to tailor the recipe to your needs with the simple press of a button.</p>

        <p class="website"><a href="https://magnolia.com/blogs/recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies-1">Magnolia</a></p>
        <p>Another simplified design, this website has even less distractions than the last, with very minimal advertisements taking up the page. I think the typeface could go up a few point sizes for legibility, or maybe change the typeface to one that is less thin.</p>

        <p class="website"><a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/birria-tacos/">Recipe Tin Eats</a></p>
        <p>This website provides background information on the dish and tips they've learned throughout the process, which I thought was different from what I've been seeing. Additionally, the instructions are very detailed with easy-to-read diagrams.</p>

    <h2>Non-Recipe Website Examples</h2>
        <p class="website"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/">NASA</a></p>
        <p>The article pages on the NASA website utilize a nice typographic hierarchy. I like how they put an image as the background for the title, as well as the colored bullet points which helps with hierarchy.</p>

        <p class="website"><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hundreds-of-google-ai-workers-were-fired-amid-fight-over-working-conditions/">WIRED</a></p>
        <p>The header being wider than the body text works nicely as it draws the reader in, gradually narrowing for a clearer read. The type choices are nice, using a legible typeface and point size. I think the margins work well for reading since our eyes aren't used to reading computer-wide line lengths.
        </p>

        <p class="website"><a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/james-mosley-1935-2025">Eye Magazine</a></p>
        <p>One thing that stood out to me about this website is it's use of the margin. In this article, the image captions are placed in the left margin, which keeps the flow of the article smooth.
